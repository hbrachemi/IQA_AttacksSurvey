    PyTorch implementation of the Fast Gradient Method.
    :param model_fn: a callable that takes an input tensor and returns predicted scores.
    :param x: input tensor.
    :param eps: epsilon (input variation parameter); see https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572.
    :param norm: Order of the norm (mimics NumPy). Possible values: np.inf, 1 or 2.
    :param clip_min: (optional) float. Minimum float value for adversarial example components.
    :param clip_max: (optional) float. Maximum float value for adversarial example components.
    :param y: Tensor with true labels. If targeted is true, then provide the
              target label. Otherwise, only provide this parameter if you'd like to use true
              labels when crafting adversarial samples.
    :param targeted: (optional) bool. Is the attack targeted or untargeted?
              Untargeted, the default, will try to make the label incorrect.
              Targeted will instead try to move in the direction of being more like y.
    :param sanity_checks: bool, if True, include asserts (Turn them off to use less runtime /
              memory or for unit tests that intentionally pass strange input)
    :param loss_fn: (optional) loss function used to compute the loss
    :return: a tensor for the adversarial example
